 * ===|Move Changes|===
 * 
 * [Synthesis]
 * No longer scaled by special attack
 * is now a single cast move rather than a channeled heal.
 * restores 50% of your health
 * PP reduced from 10 to 5
 *  ===Dev note===
 * Self sustain is perhaps the grass type's biggest claim to fame. and already they are loaded on ways to restore their health. with synthesis being pretty common
 * amongst members of the type, I decided to power it down some and make it a move that's harder to use right in the heat of combat.
 * 
 * [Recover]
 * No longer Scaled by special attack
 * healing tick rate reduced from 7 ticks per second to 5 ticks per second
 * base healing rate increased from 1% to 2%
 *  ==Dev note==
 * This essentially means that now recover heals for 10% per second, or 10 percent per PP. and at 20 max PP means the move is worth a total of 
 * 200% of your health in healing.
 * 
 * [CloseCombat]
 * fixed the issue of the move reaching farther than what is visually represented
 * decreased the hit intervals from ~11 per second to ~4 per second
